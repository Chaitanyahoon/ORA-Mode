# ORA Mode - Visual Studio Extension 🧛⚡

> "You thought it was a clean build, but it was ME, DIO!"

**ORA Mode** is a Visual Studio 2022 extension inspired by the aesthetics of *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure*. It brings a touch of dramatic flair and "Stand Energy" to your coding environment without enforcing a distracting full-IDE overhaul.

- **Teal & Pink** accents.
- **Lavender** comments.

### 🔮 Stand Ambience Window
A dockable tool window (View > Other Windows > Summon Stand Window) that provides:
- A customizable **Stand Aura** background (adjust opacity to blend with your IDE).
- **Motivation Quotes** from the JoJo universe to keep your resolve high during debugging.
